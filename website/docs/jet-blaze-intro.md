# Introduction to Jet-Blaze Framework

## What is Jet-Blaze?
The Jet-Blaze framework facilitates the development of single-page applications utilizing TypeScript, React, and RxJS. Distinguished in the field of web development, it provides innovative solutions to address both common and intricate challenges found in large-scale applications.

### Motivation
React is a great library for building the presentation layer of web applications, but it lacks some features essential for building large-scale applications.

#### React is not a Framework
Importantly, React is not a **framework**; it is a library dedicated to building user interfaces. We can build a complete application using React, but often we need to use other libraries for state management, routing, dependency injection, etc.

#### Lack of Scalability
However, as applications expand in size and complexity, managing the codebase becomes increasingly challenging. A multitude of components, services, and other classes are created, leading to challenging dependency management.

#### Lack of Reactivity
Modern web frameworks like Angular, Vue.js, SolidJS, etc., have reactivity built-in, which is very useful for building complex applications. Although FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) enhances application responsiveness, it is not inherently built into React. FRP allows for more elegant handling of asynchronous operations and makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Jet-Blaze is developed to bridge these gaps, ensuring developers have a comprehensive toolset to create highly efficient and scalable applications.

### Problems Addressed by Jet-Blaze
Jet-Blaze is designed to tackle a spectrum of challenges commonly encountered in UI and application development:
- **UI Complexity**: Managing a multitude of asynchronous events to determine the state of the UI, especially when dealing with a mix of synchronous and asynchronous code.
- **Application Growth**: As applications expand, Jet-Blaze offers strategies to divide them into manageable parts, reducing complexity and dependencies.
- **Dependency Control & Scalability**: It facilitates scaling code development while controlling dependency growth.
- **Testability**: Ensuring code stability and testability during updates is crucial for progressive development.

### Solution Offered
The framework uses components, services, and controllers to manage the application's logic and presentation. A built-in DI (Dependency Injection) container manages the lifecycle of services and controllers within the React tree structure, allowing for scope-based lifecycle management. Finally, Jet-Blaze leverages RxJS for a declarative approach to code, seamlessly handling both synchronous and asynchronous tasks.

These solutions enable developers to adhere to SOLID principles, fostering a well-structured codebase and reduced coupling, thereby simplifying maintenance.
